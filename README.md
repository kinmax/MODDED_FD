This is a modified version of Fast Downward to turn it into a landmark extractor. 

This repository does not contain all artifacts needed to build Fast Downward. You will still need to clone it from FD official repository.

All modifications made are in ```src/search/landmarks/landmark_factory.cc```, more precisely around lines 80-83
